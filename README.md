# Conversion of AndroidDevChallenge submissions Week 1 - 3

## :scroll: Description
I converted my submissions to the 
[AndroidDevChallenge](https://developer.android.com/dev-challenge) in to 
[Compose for Desktop](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose/).
* Week 1: https://github.com/timo-drick/compose_dev_challenge_1
* Week 2: https://github.com/timo-drick/compose_dev_challenge_2
* Week 3: https://github.com/timo-drick/compose_dev_challenge_3

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
To be able to use the same UI toolkit for desktop and mobile is awesome.
I just wanted to see what I have to change to be able to run the apps on desktop.
